# Daily Improvement Log

## 2026-02-25 - Surprise #1 ✅

**Focus:** trading:add_backtest_report

### What I Did

Set up **automated daily improvements** at 8:00 AM:

1. **Created `scripts/daily_improvement.sh`**
   - Generates random daily tasks from improvement pool
   - Creates task file in `memory/improvements/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Covers: Trading, ProcureAI, Memory, System, Docs

2. **Created systemd units**
   - `openclaw-daily-improvement.service` - runs the script
   - `openclaw-daily-improvement.timer` - triggers at 08:00 daily

3. **Updated HEARTBEAT.md**
   - Documented the daily improvement workflow
   - Added installation instructions

4. **Pushed trading strategy changes**
   - Repo: https://github.com/freskhu/trading-ict2022
   - Intraday exit strategy implemented

### How It Works Tomorrow

```
08:00 → systemd timer fires
      → script creates memory/improvements/2026-02-25.md
      → I read it on next heartbeat
      → Complete task → Report to you
```

### Installation Required

```bash
sudo cp ~/.openclaw/workspace/systemd/openclaw-daily-improvement.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now openclaw-daily-improvement.timer
```
