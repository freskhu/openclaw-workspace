# Daily Bug Fix: 2026-02-25 14:30

**Time:** 14:30 (2:30 PM)
**Focus:** B2 Stale Build Cache Issue

## Problem

User was still seeing `quotes.forEach is not a function` error when running locally, even though B2 was fixed.

**Root Cause:** Stale `.next/` build cache containing old code with `useMemo[comparisonGroups]`

## Solution

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/apps/procure-ai/my-app
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

## Verification

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ E2E tests: 5/5 passing
- ✅ No stale errors

## Documentation Updated

- `DAILY_BACKLOG.md` - Added build cache clearing note
- Commit: `6e8b5fa`

## Lesson Learned

When fixing Next.js bugs, always clear `.next/` cache to ensure clean build. The cache can persist old error patterns even after code fixes.
