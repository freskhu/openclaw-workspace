# Social Media Ops - Content Pillars

The 7 pillars of content for the social media presence. All content must align with at least one pillar while maintaining voice consistency.

## 1. Procurement AI & Operations
How AI is reshaping sourcing, RFQs, supplier relationships. The intersection of operations and intelligent automation.

**Topics:**
- AI-powered sourcing workflows
- Supplier relationship automation
- Cost optimization through data
- Operations efficiency

**Tone:** Practical, seen-it-all, slightly skeptical of hype

---

## 2. Trading & Markets
Systematic trading, risk management, market structure. The disciplined side of speculation.

**Topics:**
- Strategy development & backtesting
- Risk controls & position sizing
- Market microstructure
- Behavioral finance observations

**Constraints:**
- ❌ No live positions
- ❌ No PnL numbers
- ❌ No entry/exit prices
- ✅ General principles, lessons learned, system thinking

**Tone:** Measured, risk-aware, process-over-outcome

---

## 3. Agent Swarms & AI Org Design
Building teams of AI agents, orchestration patterns, the future of AI-native organizations.

**Topics:**
- Multi-agent workflows
- AI org structure
- Human-AI collaboration
- Automation architecture

**Tone:** Experimental, builder-mindset, learning in public

---

## 4. Systems Thinking
Mental models, complexity, second-order effects. The lens that ties engineering and business together.

**Topics:**
- Feedback loops
- Incentives & game theory
- Complex systems behavior
- Engineering mental models applied to business

**Tone:** Observational, pattern-matching, quietly insightful

---

## 5. Crypto & Decentralization
Blockchain infrastructure, DeFi mechanics, tokenomics. The experimental frontier of finance and coordination.

**Topics:**
- Protocol mechanics
- Tokenomics analysis
- Decentralized coordination
- Infrastructure observations

**Constraints:**
- ❌ No shilling
- ❌ No "number go up"
- ✅ Technical analysis, system design, skepticism where due

**Tone:** Curious, technically grounded, wary of hype cycles

---

## 6. Maker / 3D Printing 🆕
The physical side of iteration. Prototyping, manufacturing mindset, learning by building.

**Topics:**
- 3D printing workflows
- Prototyping iterations
- Physical product development
- Maker tools & techniques
- From CAD to physical object

**The Angle:**
Not "look at my prints" — it's about the *iteration mindset*. Failed prints teach more than successes. The same loop applies to software, trading, and operations.

**Tone:** Show-the-scars, process-focused, quietly proud of the journey

**Key Phrases:**
- "Third iteration finally held"
- "Failed print taught me..."
- "Back to CAD"
- "Tolerance stack-up in real life"

---

## 7. Learning Loop 🆕
Executive MBA + Industrial Engineering + Finance/Taxation. The ongoing project of connecting disciplines.

**Topics:**
- Cross-domain learning
- MBA insights without the LinkedIn flex
- Engineering rigor applied to business
- Finance fundamentals for operators
- Taxation as system optimization

**The Angle:**
Credentials mentioned *once* for credibility, then never again. The focus is on the *tension* between disciplines — how engineering precision clashes with business ambiguity, how finance constraints force creativity.

**Tone:** Reflective, genuinely curious, anti-credentialist despite having them

**Credibility Line (use sparingly):**
> "Background: Industrial Engineering, Welding Engineering postgrad, Executive MBA, Finance/Taxation postgrad. Currently unlearning most of it."

**Key Patterns:**
- "What engineering taught me about [business topic]"
- "What MBA taught me about [technical topic]"
- "The gap between theory and..."
- "Unlearning [assumption]"

## Pillar Combinations (High-Value Content)

Best content often sits at intersections:
- **Maker + Ops:** Physical prototyping → software iteration mindset
- **Learning Loop + Trading:** Risk management from engineering perspective
- **Agent Swarms + Learning Loop:** Teaching agents = learning yourself
- **Systems + Learning Loop:** Mental models across domains

---

## Anti-Pillars (What We Don't Do)

❌ Motivational quotes
❌ "Grindset" content
❌ Humble brags about credentials
❌ Generic AI hype
❌ Trading "signals" or calls
❌ Client work specifics
❌ Financial advice
❌ Political commentary
