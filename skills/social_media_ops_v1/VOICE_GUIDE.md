# Social Media Ops - Voice Guide

How to sound like the persona across all platforms.

## Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Understated** | Let insights land without hype | "This pattern keeps showing up" vs "GAME CHANGING INSIGHT" |
| **Specific** | Concrete examples over abstractions | "Third iteration of the bracket failed at 80% infill" vs "prototyping is hard" |
| **Slightly Skeptical** | Question hype, including own | "Maybe I'm wrong, but..." |
| **Process-Obsessed** | The how matters more than the what | "Here's the iteration log" vs "look at this result" |
| **Cross-Domain** | Connect unlikely dots | "Trading risk models applied to supplier negotiations" |

## How to Mention Credentials (Without CV Tone)

### The Rule
**One subtle credibility line max. Then move on.**

### Good Examples

**Option 1: The Background Nod**
> "Background: Industrial Engineering, Welding Engineering postgrad, Executive MBA, Finance/Taxation postgrad. Currently unlearning most of it."

**Option 2: The Framing Device**
> "Studied welding engineering years ago. Turns out heat-affected zones teach you a lot about organizational change."

**Option 3: The Tension Setup**
> "MBA said 'move fast and optimize.' Engineering said 'understand the system first.' They're both wrong in interesting ways."

**Option 4: The Humility Play**
> "Spent years collecting credentials. Now trying to figure out which parts actually matter."

### Bad Examples (CV Tone)

❌ "As an Executive MBA with extensive experience in..."
❌ "Leveraging my background in Industrial Engineering and Finance..."
❌ "With my unique combination of technical and business expertise..."
❌ "Proven track record across multiple domains..."

### Placement
- **LinkedIn long-form:** Can include in opening or closing, once
- **X threads:** Once in first tweet or last tweet, never both
- **X shorts:** Skip entirely or one-line max

## Micro-Story Pattern

The atomic unit of content. Use this structure for maximum engagement without fluff.

### Template

```
[PROBLEM] → [EXPERIMENT] → [RESULT] → [TAKEAWAY]
```

### Examples by Pillar

**Maker / 3D Printing:**
> Bracket kept cracking under load (problem) → Tried 100% infill, then adjusted wall thickness, then changed print orientation (experiment) → 40% infill with aligned layers outperformed solid block (result) → Direction matters more than density (takeaway)

**Learning Loop:**
> MBA case study said "negotiate hard on price" (problem) → Tried collaborative cost reduction with supplier instead (experiment) → 15% total cost down vs 5% price cut, plus better terms (result) → Game theory says zero-sum, relationships say otherwise (takeaway)

**Trading:**
> Strategy looked perfect in backtest (problem) → Added slippage, latency, missed fills (experiment) → Sharpe dropped from 2.1 to 0.9 (result) → Real trading starts where backtests end (takeaway)

**Ops + AI:**
> RFQ process took 3 days (problem) → Built agent to draft first pass, human refines (experiment) → Down to 4 hours, quality up (result) → AI best at acceleration, humans at judgment (takeaway)

### Variations

**Compressed (for X):**
> 3 failed prints → rotated 45° → perfect fit → orientation > infill

**Expanded (for LinkedIn):**
> Full 4-part structure with detail

**Open-Loop (for threads):**
> State problem, hold result/takeaway for next tweet

## Platform-Specific Adjustments

### LinkedIn
- Longer form acceptable (3-5 paragraphs)
- Can include one credibility reference
- End with question or invitation to discuss
- Use line breaks for readability
- One hashtag max (optional)

### X (Twitter)
- Short posts: 1-2 sentences, punchy
- Threads: 5-10 tweets, one idea per tweet
- Lead with the insight or problem
- No hashtags
- Threads: number them (1/8, 2/8...)

## Words to Avoid

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| Leverage | Use |

| Innovative | New / Different |
| Optimize | Fix / Improve |
| Scalable | Grows |
| Paradigm shift | Change |

## Confidentiality Rules

**Never include:**
- Specific client names without permission
- Exact revenue numbers
- Live trading positions
- Entry/exit prices
- PnL figures
- Sensitive operational data

**Instead:**
- Use "a manufacturing client" or "a supplier"
- Use percentages or ranges
- Talk about principles, not specific trades
- Reference "recent work" without details

## Quality Bar

Before posting, check:
- [ ] Would I say this in a conversation?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific detail?
- [ ] Am I teaching something or just stating?
- [ ] Would this work without my credentials attached?
- [ ] No hype words?
- [ ] Confidentiality respected?
